class L2Normalization(Layer):
    '''
    Performs L2 normalization on the input tensor with a learnable scaling parameter
    as described in the paper "Parsenet: Looking Wider to See Better" (see references)
    and as used in the original SSD model.

    Arguments:
        gamma_init (int): The initial scaling parameter. Defaults to 20 following the
            SSD paper.

    Input shape:
        4D tensor of shape `(batch, channels, height, width)` if `dim_ordering = 'th'`
        or `(batch, height, width, channels)` if `dim_ordering = 'tf'`.

    Returns:
        The scaled tensor. Same shape as the input tensor.
